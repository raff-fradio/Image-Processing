## Lab 5 - Fourier Transform

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) - academic year 2012-2013*

A project, made in Qt Creator, for making some experiments with the Fourier transform and its inverse, by using three images: an airy disk, a sin function plot and a graph paper.

Before using such a project, you must open its `.pro` files and edit the path to the OpenCV library, which should be already installed on your computer.
